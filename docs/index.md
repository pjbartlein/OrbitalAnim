## Animations of Earth's orbit over the past 150 kyr and month-length and insolation impacts ##

The animations here were constructed to illustrate the changing shape of Earth's orbit at 1 kyr intervals over the past 150 kyr.  Most of the animations adopt a rotating perspective, that like the view from a geostationary satellite keeps the equinoxes and solstices at the same location in the view (also known as a hula-hoop perspective). Other animations adopt a fixed (in space) perspective, where the equinoxes and solstices rotate around the orbit over time (a wagon-wheel perspective).

As the three orbital elements (eccentricity, obliquity, and climatic precession) change over time, so does the velocity of Earth along it's orbit, as illustrated by Keplerâ€™s (1609) second law of planetary motion. Earth moves faster along its elliptical orbit near perihelion and slower near aphelion. The time of year of perihelion and aphelion vary over time in a systematic way as the orbital elements change. If months are defined as a fixed angular portion of the year, then months tend to be shorter near perihelion and longer near aphelion.
