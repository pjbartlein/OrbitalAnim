## Animations of the variations Earth's orbit over the past 150 kyr, and their impacts on month-length and insolation ##

The animations here were constructed to illustrate the changing shape of Earth's orbit at 1 kyr intervals over the past 150 kyr.  Most of the animations adopt a rotating perspective, that like the view from a geostationary satellite keeps the equinoxes and solstices at the same location in the view (also known as a hula-hoop perspective). Other animations adopt a fixed (in space) perspective, where the equinoxes and solstices rotate around the orbit over time (a wagon-wheel perspective).

As the three orbital elements (eccentricity, obliquity, and climatic precession) change over time, so does the velocity of Earth along it's orbit, as illustrated by Keplerâ€™s (1609) second law of planetary motion. Earth moves faster along its elliptical orbit near perihelion and slower near aphelion. The time of year of perihelion and aphelion vary over time in a systematic way as the orbital elements change. If months are defined as a fixed angular portion of the year, then months tend to be shorter near perihelion and longer near aphelion.

... etc.

The animations include:

- [[orb_0ka.html]](https://pjbartlein.github.io/OrbitalAnim/orb_0ka/orb_0ka.html) The present-day elliptical orbit, showing the position of the Earth at 5-degree intervals during the year. 
- [[orb_perih_position]](https://pjbartlein.github.io/OrbitalAnim/orb_perih_position/orb_perih_position.html) Earth's orbit at 1-kyr intervals over the past 150 kyr, showing the changing time of year of perihelion.
- [[orb_monlen]](https://pjbartlein.github.io/OrbitalAnim/orb_monlen/orb_monlen.html) An animated version of Fig. 1 in Bartlein and Shafer (2019, GMD), showing the orbit, and month-length "anomalies" (long-term mean differences between 0 ka (1950 CE) and each time.  Months are defined by the present-day (1950 CE) angles they subtend.
- [[orb_monangle]](https://pjbartlein.github.io/OrbitalAnim/orb_monangle/orb_monangle.html) An animated version of Fig. 1 in Bartlein and Shafer (2019, GMD), showing the orbit, and month-length "anomalies" (long-term mean differences between 0 ka (1950 CE) and each time.  Months are defined as 12 equal angular segments.
- [[orb_monlen_fixed_perih]](https://pjbartlein.github.io/OrbitalAnim/orb_monlen_fixed_perih/orb_monlen_fixed_perih.html) Month-length anomalies as viewed relative to a fixed location of perihelion on the images (wagon-wheel perspective). Months are defined by the present-day (1950 CE) angles they subtend.

For the sake of illustration, eccentricity has been exaggerated by ten for plotting in each animation, but the geometric positions, and the orbital speed in `orb_0ka.gif`, have been calculated using the true eccentricity values.

Animations were constructed using HAniS [[https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/hanis/]](https://www.ssec.wisc.edu/hanis/) by Tom Whittaker, Space Science & Engineering Center (SSEC) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

The individual .png files that make up the animations were created in R [[https://www.r-project.org/]](https://www.r-project.org/).

Month lengths and insolation values were calculated using programs from [[PaleoCalAdjust]](https://github.com/pjbartlein/PaleoCalAdjust) (Bartlein, P. J. and Shafer, S. L.: Paleo calendar-effect adjustments in time-slice and transient climate-model simulations (PaleoCalAdjust v1.0): impact and strategies for data analysis, *Geosci.
